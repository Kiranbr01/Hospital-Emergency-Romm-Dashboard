# 🏥 Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard

##  Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an **interactive Excel dashboard** that provides insights into the **Hospital Emergency Room (ER)** operations.  
It helps stakeholders **monitor patient flow, analyze admission trends, satisfaction levels, and waiting times** — ultimately supporting better hospital management decisions and improved patient services.

## 📊 KPI’s (Key Performance Indicators)
| KPI | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Number of Patients** | Total number of patients visiting the ER per day. Shows trends with an area sparkline for identifying busy days or seasonal patterns. |
| **Average Wait Time** | Average time patients wait to be attended by medical staff. Highlights days with delays needing attention. |
| **Patient Satisfaction Score** | Average satisfaction rating from patients to measure service quality and operational efficiency. |
| **Admission Status** | Comparison between patients admitted vs. not admitted to evaluate hospital load and service efficiency. |
| **Age Distribution** | Groups patients by age category to understand demographics. |
| **Gender Analysis** | Shows patient distribution by gender. |
| **Timeliness** | Percentage of patients seen on time (within 30 minutes). |
| **Department Referrals** | Displays the departments patients are most often referred to (e.g., Orthopedics, Cardiology, etc.). |

## ⚙️ Process
1. **Data Collection:** Imported hospital emergency data into Excel from a CSV or manual dataset.  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates, handled blanks, and formatted data for analysis using Excel functions and filters.  
3. **Data Analysis:**
   - Used formulas such as `AVERAGEIF`, `COUNTIF`, and `IFERROR` for KPI calculations.  
   - Applied conditional formatting for highlighting critical metrics.  
4. **Dashboard Creation:**
   - Created charts (bar, pie, area, sparkline) for each KPI.  
   - Used slicers for **Month** and **Year (2023, 2024)** to make the dashboard interactive.  
   - Combined charts and KPIs into a clean, professional layout using Excel shapes and icons.
5. **Validation & Testing:** Ensured calculated KPIs matched expected results and visual clarity was maintained.
